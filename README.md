# UFOs
## Overview of the analysis
Dana asked me to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, I added table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Results

The home page of the HTML website contains a jumbo header with a descriptive title of what this page is about.

The search function is very user friendly, with descriptive placeholders in each search field to help the user.
Whenever you fill in a search box with the right criteria, the data updates automatically.
If you want to search for any UFO sightings in the city of Naples, just fill in the city field with "Naples" and the following data with show.

You can also search using multiple criteria, such as country: us and shape: light

## Summary
One draw back that I have found frustrating is that there is no longer a button to press after I fill in all the criteria, it helped me know when the search was running. With that, one additional recommendation I would offer is to add back the button. It adds a better user experience as its more fun and helpful. My next recommendation would be to eliminate the black space by moving the search field up thus allowing the data to fill in the black space, this will give users more area to read.
